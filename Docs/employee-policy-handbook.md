# Holidays & leave policy

Osmosys has a total of 12 festival &amp; national holidays every year. Considering that India has many festivals of different importance depending on region &amp; religion, all efforts are made to select this list in a manner that benefits staff &amp; organization. The list is made available as soon as possible every year and the employees are advised to keep track of these holidays.

All confirmed employees are entitled to 18 days of paid leave in a calendar year. This leave is calculated depending on the date of joining the Organization. Similarly, when an Employee exits the organization, the leaves they are entitled to take shall get apportioned based on their date of resignation. If they have used more leaves than they are entitled to, the remaining leaves shall be considered as Loss of Pay and shall be adjusted in the full and final settlement.

Leave is a privilege provided by Osmosys for general welfare of the employee. Leave can be granted ONLY after considering the exigencies of work. The employee has a provision to take leaves for their personal work but is expected to do so with prior permission of their reporting manager.

Osmosys encourages its staff to take these leaves in a well-planned manner so they enjoy their vacation while the Projects and the Clients are not impacted negatively. To this effect, an employee is recommended to spread their leaves across the year.

Osmosys encourages all its employees to utilize their leaves so that their work/life is balanced. Therefore, the leaves provided during a year cannot be en-cashed or carried over to the next year.

Employees who completed 6 months of service get the following special paid leaves

- a special leave of 5 consecutive working days when they get married once during the tenure at Osmosys
- A special leave of 5 consecutive working days in case of death in immediate family
- a special leave of 5 consecutive working days is provided to Men during their child birth, for the first two children.

For women employees, maternity leave of 26 weeks shall be given at the time of delivery of the baby (for the delivery of their first and second child). A woman with two or more children will get 12 weeks of maternity leave as per the Maternity Benefits (Amendment) Act, 2016.

During probation period, following leaves are provided

- Less than 3 years of relevant work experience - no leaves provided during probation period
- Between 3 - 6 years of relevant work experience - 3 leaves are provided during probation period
- Above 6 years of relevant work experience - 6 leaves are provided during probation period.

Any leaves taken beyond the allowed limit as mentioned above will be Loss of Pay and may lead to the extension of the probation period at the discretion of the Manager.

All leaves need to be applied in GreytHR Portal marked to the reporting manager with prior notice of a minimum of 3 working days (Excluding Saturdays).

In the event of an emergency, Employee may avail leave for a day without prior notice. However, all attempts should be made to inform their manager about the leave in advance or during the day. In case of absence without information for three consecutive days, the Employee will be considered to have abandoned services and the process of termination will be initiated.

**“No Unplanned Leaves” Period:**

Sometimes during a year, before or after major festivals or long weekends, quite a few employees take vacation to visit families or travel. During such times the company runs with limited resources attending to the needs of the clients. Under such circumstances, even one more employee taking an unplanned leave affects the project and causes inconvenience to the client. Osmosees are requested to abstain from taking unplanned leaves during this period and if they have to take leave under unavoidable circumstances, it shall be considered “Loss of Pay” leave. This applies even if the employee has leave balance greater than 0.

The “Loss of Pay” leave days are not deducted from the leave balance of that employee.

**“No Unplanned Leaves”** period will be intimated to Osmosees well in advance. Planned leaves during this time will be approved by the mentor / management strictly based on the project work, resources available and the employee’s history of taking leaves. Any unplanned leaves (including sick leaves) taken in continuation with a holiday or a planned leave during this period are “Loss of Pay” leaves.

# Working on a Holiday / Weekly-off

# Jungfrau and/or PineStem

All tasks are assigned to Osmosees through Jungfrau and/or Pinestem.

Every Osmosee is advised to complete their tasks and reassign as per the process.

All efforts spent on any task shall be properly updated along with detailed comments on the work done. The task must also be assigned the correct status and to the correct person.

In case anyone is asked to do a task that is not in the Jungfrau/Pinestem, they shall request their team leader to create and assign a task to log their work hours against that task.

It is suggested that the total hours spent must reflect in Jungfrau/Pinestem, either in one task or many tasks.

Not updating Jungfrau/Pinestem tasks and the hours spent on various tasks properly will have an impact on the quarterly reviews in accordance with the billing policy [Billing | Soochna (osmosys.co)](https://soochna.osmosys.co/books/osm-policies/page/billing)

# Billing

An employee irrespective of the Working shift and Weekend needs to put in 9 hours of work on a working day. These hours must be entered in Jungfrau or Pinestem against the tasks he/she has been assigned and worked on that day. It is mandatory for the employee to enter these hours on the same working day.

<span style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">[https://soochna.osmosys.co/books/osm-processes/chapter/sexual-harassment-of-women-at-workplace-policy](https://soochna.osmosys.co/books/osm-processes/chapter/sexual-harassment-of-women-at-workplace-policy)</span>

# Conflict of interest

Conflict of interest arises whenever the personal, professional or business interests of an employee are potentially at odds with the best interests of Osmosys.

Employees should aim to avoid being put in a situation where there may be a conflict between the interests of Osmosys and their own personal or professional interests, or those of relatives or friends. Where such a conflict occurs (or is perceived to occur), the interests of Osmosys will be balanced against the interests of the employee and, unless exceptional circumstances exist, resolved in favor of Osmosys. It is impossible to define all potential areas of conflict of interest. If an employee is in doubt if a conflict exists, they should raise the matter with their manager / HR.

Employees must:

- declare any potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest that exist on becoming employed by Osmosys to management
- declare any potential, actual or perceived conflicts of interest that arise or are likely to arise during employment by Osmosys to management
- avoid being placed in a situation where there is potential, actual or perceived conflict of interest if at all possible
- No outside projects or part time employment or freelancing with anyone else while in the service of Osmosys.

If an employee declares such an interest, Osmosys will review the potential areas of conflict with the employee and mutually agree on practical arrangements to resolve the situation.

Employees must disclose any involvement with other organizations / institutes in any capacity that might cause a conflict of interest with Osmosys to their manager/HR. Where there are external involvements that do not represent a conflict of interest, these must not affect performance or attendance whilst working at Osmosys. If such involvement does affect performance or attendance it will be considered a conflict of interest.

Employees must not set up or engage in private business or undertake other employment in direct or indirect competition with Osmosys using knowledge and/or materials gained during the course of employment with Osmosys.

Engaging in other business interests during work hours will result in termination of employment with immediate effect and without any discussion.

Failure to declare a potential, actual or perceived conflict of interest or to take remedial action agreed with Osmosys, in a timely manner, may result in performance improvement proceedings including termination of employment.

# Intellectual property and security

All intellectual property including all programs written, documents created and any other work executed by employees during their employment with Osmosys, including discoveries or inventions made in the performance of their duties related in any way to the business of Osmosys, will remain the property of Osmosys.

Employees may be given access to confidential information, access to servers, data, business property, keys to premises or any other business related property/information in the performance of their duties. This must be protected and used only in the interests of Osmosys. Uploading or sharing of any code, data or any kind of information on or through any electronic / internet platforms is not acceptable.

Employees must not:

- disclose or use any part of any confidential information outside of the performance of their duties and in the interests of Osmosys; or
- Authorize or be involved in the improper use or disclosure of confidential information during or after their employment without the Employer's written consent, other than as required by law.
- Include the client code / documents / credentials / servers details in any of the repositories accessible by any one excluding the corresponding client and the project team. This includes Github and other such softwares. Osmosys reserves the right to check any employee’s personal / public repositories to ensure that the confidential code / documents are not included.

‘Confidential information’ includes any information in any form relating to Osmosys and related bodies, clients or businesses, which is not in the public domain. Employees must act in good faith towards Osmosys and must prevent (or if impractical, report) the unauthorized disclosure of any confidential information. Failure to comply with this policy may result in performance improvement proceedings including termination of employment, and Osmosys may also pursue monetary damages or other remedies allowed by law.

# Coding Standards

In an effort to improve the overall quality of service provided by Osmosys to its client, certain standards and guidelines are published from time to time. All such standards and guidelines are made available to the staff for their exclusive reading &amp; understanding. Following the standards is crucial to a project and to ensure this:

1. Its mandatory to take standards exams if you are working in a particular technology
2. Every month there will be standards exam.
3. If in case you happened to be on leave on the day of the exam or could not take the exam due to a client call or inevitable happening, you can submit the same justification to HR &amp; LND team so as to avoid getting negative points. (Once Training Pegasus final version is incorporated for the standards exams, then you can take the exam any time convenient to you but on the stipulated date or on the immediate working date)
4. Having coding standards knowledge &amp; passing the exam is essential to the programming job; Hence, no positive points are assigned for passing the standards exam.
5. For every failure, 2 points will be deducted from PDR points.
6. Re-attempt is every week.
7. If an Osmosee passes the exam every month in the first attempt for 3 months, then they will have only one exam in the next quarter. If they fail in the quarterly exam, they will have to attempt the exams in every month of the quarter and pass.
8. Points deduction happens from the Project Delivery category in the PDR. The deduction is capped at 10 points irrespective of how many times they fail.
9. It’s strongly advised that this learning is applied sincerely to your programming work to ensure the quality of work. So, once you pass the exam, it's expected that your coding does not exhibit poor standards.

It is to be noted that the Coding Standards documents are confidential, and staff shall ensure the same is not distributed to anyone other than current Osmosys staff.

# Employee Separation

At the time of leaving the company, an employee is expected to leave causing minimum impact on the clients. In view of this, an employee is requested to give a notice of three months. An employee can be released earlier or can also be asked to stay longer in the interest of the organization.

Employee is not entitled to take leave during the notice period. If an employee has to take leave for some unavoidable conditions, the company can extend their last working day by the number of leaves taken during notice period. The leaves taken during notice period will be Loss of Pay.

A Knowledge transfer must be initiated when an employee is leaving the company. HR / team leader will initiate this process. The separating employee must provide all necessary knowledge transfer and co-operate in a smooth handover.

Separating employee shall not provide their colleague or team leaders contact for employment verification. All such employment verification mails from next employer or any third party company must be addressed to [verifications@osmosys.co](mailto:verifications@osmosys.asia) only. Verification mails sent to any team lead or managers will not be responded.

# Suspension Policy

An employee might be put under Suspension as a consequence to a disciplinary action initiated against them. Some of the situations include police FIR, internal disciplinary actions.

The clauses covered under the Suspension are:

- The duration of Suspension varies based on the gravity of the offense, as decided by the management
- The entire duration is considered Loss of Pay for the Employee
- Access to official email and Servers shall be revoked during this period
- No Client interaction is permitted during this period
- The employee cannot undertake employment with any other organization or Freelancing/Consultancy during this period
- The agreement period gets extended by this duration (non-working time).
- The suspension might lead to termination based on the seriousness of the offense and/or if the employee doesn’t show the expected improvement in his/her work.

**Suspension revoking**

Any suspension is revoked on the completion of the suspension period or on the conclusion of an investigation.

# Variable Pay

For building a successful and productive work model at Osmosys, the employees are encouraged to lead their juniors and thus constantly move up in the hierarchy.

Towards achieving this, the company pays "Variable Pay" as a component of the Monthly compensation, for the team management by a Manager/Team Lead/Sub-Lead.

We recognize up to two levels of management for the compensation to be paid. Here are a few points considered for calculating the Monthly Variable Pay.

- For every 180 Hours put in by an employee (below the level of Team Leaders/Principal Engineers), their immediate Manager gets a compensation of Rs 560/- and the next level manager gets a compensation of Rs 140/-
- In case an employee has only one manager above him/her, the manager gets paid Rs 560/-
- The Variable Pay is calculated based on actual hours (billable + non-billable) from the Billing report generated from Pinestem &amp; Jungfrau.
- In case an employee works under two or more managers in a month, the variable pay is split among the managers based on the actual hours billed under their projects.

Ex: A Sub-Lead with 3 people working full-time (180 Hours) under him/her will get paid Rs 560 \* 3 = Rs 1,680/- as the Variable Pay. Their Manager/Team Leader is paid Rs 140 \* 3 = Rs 420/- for managing the three employees. When the sub-lead puts in 180 hours of work, their Manager/Team Leader gets additional pay of Rs 560/- for managing the sub-lead.

As the Variable pay can be calculated only after the calendar month ends, the variable pay for a month is paid as a part of the succeeding month salary. Ex: Variable Pay for April 2023 Efforts gets paid with the May 2023 Salary on 1-Jun-2023.

# PDR Policy

PDR (Performance Development Review) is done quarterly for all employees at Osmosys to evaluate their performance; help them improve their performance and set goals for the next quarter. The PDR process is automated in the Osmosys SharePoint.

- The PDR for a quarter will start by 25th of the Quarter ending month and needs to be completed before 10th of the new quarter beginning month. Ex: PDR for Jan – Mar 2023, needs to be completed by 10-Apr-2023.
- The PDRs are initiated and scheduled by the HR Department in consultation with the Reporting Manager.
- PDR is done by the Reporting Manager.
- Each time an employee fails in the Coding Standards exam, 2 points will be deducted from Project Delivery category of the PDR.
- <span class="ui-provider ks bit bfi ccu ccv ccw ccx ccy ccz cda cdb cdc cdd cde cdf cdg cdh cdi cdj cdk cdl cdm cdn cdo cdp cdq cdr cds cdt cdu cdv cdw cdx cdy cdz" dir="ltr">Each time an employee gets an escalation to HR from the Team Leader, 5 points will be deducted from PDR.</span>
- The PDR is not skipped for any reason including the previous quarter score.
- The hike cycle is related to the PDR Score as given below:

[![image.png](https://soochna.osmosys.co/uploads/images/gallery/2023-09/scaled-1680-/Apsimage.png)](https://soochna.osmosys.co/uploads/images/gallery/2023-09/Apsimage.png)

- If an employee gets a PDR Score of 1 in a quarter, he/she shall be asked to report at office and will be put in PIP (Performance Improvement Plan) immediately. Any employee is given up to 2 weeks' notice to report at office. 
    - If the Salary revision/Confirmation is due in the next quarter, it gets delayed by a quarter.
    - Ex: A Confirmed Employee gets 1 in the quarter Jan – Mar 2023 and the Salary revision is due on 1-Apr-2023, it gets postponed to 1-Jul-2023.
    - If a trainee gets a 1 in the quarter Jan – Mar 2023 and his/her confirmation is due on 1-Apr/1-May/1-Jun-2023, his/her probation is extended by 3 months.
- Another score of 1 in the consecutive quarter following a ‘1’ in the previous quarter will lead to immediate termination. The Company reserves the right to report this in the Relieving Documents and Ex-Employee Verifications.
- All the previous PDR Scores (1 to 5) get reset upon a Salary Revision and the Annual Cycle restarts.

PDR Scoring is revised w.e.f 1-Oct-2023 as follows. It is applicable for the PDRs starting with Oct - Dec2023.

### Mockoon

#### About

In frontend development, timely delivery of API development is crucial to prevent delays in project timelines. However, dependencies on API delivery can often hinder the frontend development process. To mitigate this, two strategies are often employed:

1. **Pre-Development API Specification**: Providing detailed API specifications to frontend teams before the actual development begins can help in planning and structuring frontend development accordingly. Although AI tools have been explored for automating this process, they often require human intervention for validation and testing, including handling various response scenarios.
2. **Mock API Servers**: Another effective approach is the use of mock API servers, like Mockoon. Mockoon is a free, open-source, cross-platform tool that allows developers to simulate API responses locally without the need for a live backend. It doesn't require user accounts or logins, making it accessible and easy to use. This method enables frontend developers to proceed with component development and integration without waiting for the actual APIs to be developed and deployed.

Using mock APIs provides a practical workaround for the interdependency challenges between frontend and backend development phases, ensuring smoother workflow and minimizing project delays.
